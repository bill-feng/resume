# Bill Feng

Thank you for visiting my GitHub resume!

I am a curious software engineer who likes to think deeply about problems,
search for elegant solutions, and strive to perfect the user experience. I love
software and am constantly amazed by how a brilliant idea coupled with the right
lines of code can bring tremendous positive impact to the world. However, I also
believe the most important problems we have are internal, and technology isn't
always the best solution. I want to find a junction point between the
technological and the spiritual, and search along that thin line for a means of
purposeful living. I hope to utilize my talents to increase the overall
happiness, wellbeing, and fulfillment of as many people as possible, and maybe
make a lot of money through the process! ðŸ’°ðŸ˜œ

Take a look at my [professional experience](#-professional-experience),
[projects](#-projects), and [skills](#-skills). If you would like to get to know
me better, or have an opportunity to work together, [contact me](#-contact)
and let's have a chat over coffee!
